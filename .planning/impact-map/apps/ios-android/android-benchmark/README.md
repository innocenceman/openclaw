# Android Benchmark

Coverage: `exceptioned-deep-partial`
Freshness: 2026-05-08 repo-native structural inspection only

## Scope

Leaf module for `apps/android/benchmark/**`.

## Leaf status

This leaf currently acts as a macrobenchmark harness module with committed Gradle configuration and connected-test expectations, but little committed benchmark source beyond that harness boundary.

## Detail files

- `file-roles.md`: concrete file/path ownership and likely impact radius.
- `code-paths.md`: behavior paths to trace before changing code.
- `change-to-test.md`: smallest validation ladder for common changes.

## v2026.4.24 semantic refresh

- Transition: `v2026.3.28 -> v2026.4.24`.
- Feature group: `mobile-desktop-apps`.
- Risk: `high`.
- Compatibility: `behavior-change`.
- Changed paths in this leaf: `1` (修改 1).
- Target-existing changed paths listed here: `1`.
- Deleted or renamed-away paths are intentionally not repeated in active impact-map: `0`; see `.planning/version-diff/v2026.3.28...v2026.4.24/deleted-paths.txt` and `obsolete-impact-map-references.json`.
- Coverage source: active target-version impact-map plus `.planning/version-diff/v2026.3.28...v2026.4.24/leaf-impact.json`.

Representative target-version paths:

- `apps/android/benchmark/build.gradle.kts`

Refresh note: generated from target-version diff facts after GitNexus and code-review-graph target-source refresh. Active impact-map intentionally avoids exact references to target-deleted source paths.
