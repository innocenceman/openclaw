Coverage: `partial`
Freshness: 2026-05-07 repo-native structural inspection only

| Change type                    | First validation                                                | Escalation trigger                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manifest/config changed        | `pnpm test:contracts:plugins` and affected plugin catalog tests | Escalate to docs/UI/config checks for user-facing changes. |
| Runtime implementation changed | `pnpm test -- extensions/voice-call` or nearest targeted test   | `pnpm test:extensions` when shared helpers are touched.    |
| Package/build surface changed  | `pnpm build` when published or lazy-loaded surface changes      | Run plugin release checks if package metadata changes.     |

## Validation evidence

No product tests/builds/graph indexes were run while creating this leaf. Add dated command output before promoting beyond `partial`.

## v2026.4.24 refresh validation focus

- Changed paths: `80` (删除 6，修改 55，新增 19).
- Target-existing path refs in active map: `74`; deleted/renamed-away refs kept only in transition artifacts: `6`.
- Risk: `medium`; compatibility: `behavior-change`.
- First validation move: Run targeted tests for the changed paths and inspect compatibility-sensitive call sites before broad validation.
- Version-diff validation must keep active `.planning/impact-map` free of exact target-deleted path references.
