# opencode-go Provider Plugin Change-to-Test Matrix

Coverage: `partial`
Freshness: 2026-05-07 repo-native structural inspection only

| Change type                             | First validation                                                        | Escalation trigger                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provider manifest/auth metadata changed | `pnpm test:contracts:plugins` plus provider auth/catalog contract tests | Escalate to docs/UI settings sync if user-facing labels or env vars change. |
| Provider runtime behavior changed       | `pnpm test -- extensions/opencode-go` or nearest provider test          | `pnpm test:extensions` when shared provider helpers are touched.            |
| Package/build surface changed           | `pnpm build` when published or lazy-loaded surface changes              | Run plugin release checks if package metadata changes.                      |

## Validation evidence

No product tests/builds/graph indexes were run while creating this leaf. Add dated command output before promoting beyond `partial`.

## v2026.4.24 refresh validation focus

- Changed paths: `13` (修改 6，新增 6，删除 1).
- Target-existing path refs in active map: `12`; deleted/renamed-away refs kept only in transition artifacts: `1`.
- Risk: `high`; compatibility: `behavior-change`.
- First validation move: Run the closest targeted tests for this leaf before any broad suite, then add integration or contract coverage for the owning boundary.
- Version-diff validation must keep active `.planning/impact-map` free of exact target-deleted path references.
