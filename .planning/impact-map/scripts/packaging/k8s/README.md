# Scripts k8s

Coverage: `exceptioned-deep-partial`
Freshness: 2026-05-09 GitNexus/code-review-graph bounded slice plus targeted docs/script checks

## Scope

Leaf module for `scripts/k8s/**`.

## Observed facts

- 7 files observed in `scripts/k8s/`.
- Sample files:
- `scripts/k8s/create-kind.sh`
- `scripts/k8s/deploy.sh`
- `scripts/k8s/manifests/configmap.yaml`
- `scripts/k8s/manifests/deployment.yaml`
- `scripts/k8s/manifests/kustomization.yaml`
- No direct root `package.json` script values pointed at this directory during Wave 4 inspection; usage is via direct invocation, adjacent wrappers, or imports.

## Incoming dependencies

- Build/check/test/release/docs flows usually enter from root `package.json` scripts, direct shell invocation, or neighboring wrappers.

## Outgoing dependencies

- `docs/install/kubernetes.md` is the adjacent operator guide for these scripts.

## Risk triggers

- Renaming scripts without updating root wrappers or docs examples.
- Changing helper semantics that multiple wrappers or CI flows assume.

## Validation status

Wave 4 did not execute packaging/release/install/live environment actions for this leaf. Coverage is based on repo-native inspection of script files, wrapper references, and root package-script wiring.

## v2026.4.24 semantic refresh

- Transition: `v2026.3.28 -> v2026.4.24`.
- Feature group: `build-ci-tests`.
- Risk: `medium`.
- Compatibility: `compatible`.
- Changed paths in this leaf: `1` (修改 1).
- Target-existing changed paths listed here: `1`.
- Deleted or renamed-away paths are intentionally not repeated in active impact-map: `0`; see `.planning/version-diff/v2026.3.28...v2026.4.24/deleted-paths.txt` and `obsolete-impact-map-references.json`.
- Coverage source: active target-version impact-map plus `.planning/version-diff/v2026.3.28...v2026.4.24/leaf-impact.json`.

Representative target-version paths:

- `docs/install/kubernetes.md`

Refresh note: generated from target-version diff facts after GitNexus and code-review-graph target-source refresh. Active impact-map intentionally avoids exact references to target-deleted source paths.
