# Scripts pre-commit Code Paths

Coverage: `exceptioned-deep-partial`
Freshness: 2026-05-08 repo-native inspection only

## Invocation path

1. Root package scripts, direct shell use, or neighboring wrappers invoke this leaf.
2. Files under `scripts/pre-commit/` perform the leaf-specific automation.
3. Validation then flows into the closest wrapper script, docs page, or test called out in this leaf's file roles.

## Trace rule

Start from the entry command or wrapper that actually invokes the script, then walk into helpers and downstream artifacts before deciding how broad validation must be.

## v2026.4.24 target-existing changed source paths

This target refresh maps `3` changed path(s) to this final leaf. `3` path(s) still exist in the target source and are listed below. Deleted or renamed-away paths remain only in version-diff artifacts, not active impact-map. Status counts: `{'M': 2, 'A': 1}`.
