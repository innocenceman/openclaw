# Scripts docs-i18n Code Paths

Coverage: `exceptioned-deep-partial`
Freshness: 2026-05-08 repo-native inspection only

## Invocation path

1. Root package scripts, direct shell use, or neighboring wrappers invoke this leaf.
2. Files under `scripts/docs-i18n/` perform the leaf-specific automation.
3. Validation then flows into the closest wrapper script, docs page, or test called out in this leaf's file roles.

## Trace rule

Start from the entry command or wrapper that actually invokes the script, then walk into helpers and downstream artifacts before deciding how broad validation must be.
