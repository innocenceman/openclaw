# Docs debug Code Paths

Coverage: `exceptioned-deep-partial`
Freshness: 2026-05-08 repo-native inspection only

## Content-to-route path

1. A page in `docs/debug` changes or moves.
2. Local index pages plus `docs/docs.json` determine whether the route stays reachable in Mintlify.
3. `pnpm check:docs` and `pnpm docs:check-links` are the first automated checks.

## Translation gate path

1. English page titles, section labels, or short nav labels change.
2. `pnpm docs:check-i18n-glossary` confirms whether glossary coverage is still complete.
3. Locale regeneration stays downstream of approved glossary updates and was not executed during Wave 4.

## Trace rule

When a page change is meant to document a behavior change in code, trace from the docs page to the owning product/config/plugin surface before deciding whether a product test needs to run.
