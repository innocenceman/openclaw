# Extension Test Helpers

Coverage: `verified`
Freshness: 2026-05-08 P0 refresh-to-verified evidence recorded

## Scope

Leaf module for `test/helpers/extensions/**`.

## Boundary

Extension/plugin fixture builders and helpers used by extension tests.

## Evidence

Repo-native path inspection of the relevant `test/**`, package script, and fixture/helper roots. No broad test suite was run for this documentation-only wave.

## Detail files

- `file-roles.md`: concrete file/path ownership and likely impact radius.
- `code-paths.md`: behavior paths to trace before changing code.
- `change-to-test.md`: smallest validation ladder for common changes.
