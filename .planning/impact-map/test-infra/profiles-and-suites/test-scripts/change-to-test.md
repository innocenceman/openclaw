| Change                                     | First checks                                                                            | Broader validation                                                                                                            |

| Edit files in this leaf                    | Run the nearest scoped `pnpm test -- <path-or-filter>` that exercises the changed file. | `OPENCLAW_TEST_PROFILE=low OPENCLAW_TEST_SERIAL_GATEWAY=1 pnpm test` on constrained hosts, or full `pnpm test` when feasible. |
| Change shared runner/setup/helper behavior | Run direct tests for the helper/runner plus one representative consumer suite.          | Full `pnpm test` before landing if related failures are plausible.                                                            |
| Change fixtures or mocks                   | Run tests that consume the fixture/mock and inspect snapshot/fixture assumptions.       | Add targeted regression tests when a fixture contract changes.                                                                |

## Minimum evidence for `verified`

Do not promote to `verified` until fresh scoped or full test output passes; G009 currently records a failing `test/scripts/test-parallel.test.ts` rerun.
